# Measuring-Effect-Sizes-in-Experimental-Data
I calculated multiple effect size metrics including Cohen’s d, Eta-squared (η²), and Pearson’s r to assess the practical importance of interventions or treatments in different datasets (e.g., crop yields under different treatments, test scores between classes). These metrics were used to support clearer decision-making beyond just p-values.
